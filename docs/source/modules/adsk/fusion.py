This is particularly useful when you need a body made up entirely of NURBS surfaces. The tempId on the faces, edges, and vertices on the new body will match with the corresponding tempId on the original body. In cases where faces are split as a result of the conversion there can be more than one face or edge in the new body that matches to a single face or edge in the original body. The findByTempId method will find the entity with the matching id.

        indexList : An array of integers that represent indices into the coordinates to define which coordinates to use when drawing points. If an empty array is provided, a point is drawn for every coordinate.
        pointType : Specifies the type of point to display. Currently there are two choices; UserDefinedCustomGraphicsPointType and PointCloudCustomGraphicsPointType. When set to PointCloudCustomGraphicsPointType, each point displays as a single pixel and is the most efficient point display type for displaying sets that contain very large quantities of points. When set to UserDefinedCustomGraphicsPointType, you specify the image to display as the point. This can be any png image and is centered on the point.
        pointImage : If the pointType is PointCloudCustomGraphicsPointType this argument is ignored and can be an empty string. This argument must be specified if the pointType is UserDefinedCustomGraphicsPointType. This is the path to the png image file that will be displayed as the point. It can be either a full path to the file or a relative path that is respect to the .py, dll, or dylib file being run. There is no restriction on the size of the image, but generally very small images would be used for points.
